              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The
              Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see and know
              about the universe around us. We'll locate the various
              constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
              the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world

              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come
              not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
              wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how

              whole planet.

              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
              exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a
              series of installations that allow visitors to experience the
              power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
              powering lighting, to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are
              able to use and control wind to create power.
